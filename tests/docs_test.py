"""Tests that keep the operations docs in step with the code.

``docs/`` has no build and no autodoc, so a page describing a worker's
decision table is prose that can silently fall behind the module it
describes. These tests are the substitute: they read the published
Markdown and assert that every case, counter, field, and knob the code
actually has is named somewhere on the page.

They deliberately check for *presence* and nothing else. A test cannot
tell whether a sentence explains a bucket correctly, but it can refuse
to let a bucket be added to the planner — or a key to the queue job's
``progress`` — without the operations page gaining the word for it,
which is the failure mode a docs page of this kind actually has.
